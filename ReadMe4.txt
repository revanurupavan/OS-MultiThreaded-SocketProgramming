Purpose of the project:

The purpose of the project is to work with concurrent server and client architecture in linux using fork().



Name of the Source Code files:
1. server.c
2. client.c

How to run the executable files:
1 ./server.o 
2 ./client.o 


Note: If the server is stopped and executed, the port number on both the programs has to be changed to match accordingly. 
The server does not bind as the port is already used up. 


The client and server codes are executed only on one system. The IP address is not changed to work on any system. The IP address is 127.0.0.1 on both the programs.

Way of executing Change Directory:
Give the whole command on client side. Eg: cd ..  to go to the previous directory. The pwd is displayed and the pwd after the command is displayed in the second line on the server side.
